# OpenSense Noise  
## Systemic Interference Processing Engine

### Purpose
Controlled processing and transformation of communication interference.

### Core Concept
- **THRUCOK IL Processing**: Structured noise pathway management
- **Interference Transformation**: Converting noise to useful data
- **Signal/Noise Differentiation**: Automated classification system

### Architecture
```
Raw Input → [Noise Identification] → THRUCOK Processing → [Transformation/Isolation]
```

### Key Features
- Pattern-based noise classification
- Context-aware interference handling
- Cross-language noise processing (Igbo, Korean, English)
- Music and audio noise specialization

### Integration
Receives filtered noise from openaxis-nonoise for processing
